Usage
-----

Generating image CAPTCHA with the :class:`ImageCaptcha` class is incredibly straightforward.


.. code-block:: python

    from io import BytesIO
    from captcha.image import ImageCaptcha

    captcha = ImageCaptcha()
    data: BytesIO = captcha.generate('ABCD')

The result image would be something like:

.. figure:: ./_static/image-demo.png

   This image CAPTCHA is generated by above code

Fonts
-----

The ``ImageCaptcha`` library comes with one built-in font named "DroidSansMono",
which is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. However, it is recommended to use
your own custom fonts for generating CAPTCHA images.

.. code-block:: python

    custom_fonts = ['path/to/your/custom_font.ttf']
    captcha = ImageCaptcha(fonts=[custom_fonts])

On the fly
----------

Let's explore how to use the CAPTCHA library to dynamically render image
CAPTCHAs within a Flask application. This allows you to generate CAPTCHA
images dynamically and serve them directly to users when they access a
specific endpoint.

.. code-block:: python

    from flask import Flask, Response
    from captcha.image import ImageCaptcha

    image = ImageCaptcha()
    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route("/captcha")
    def captcha_view():
        # add your own logic to generate the code
        code = "ABCD"
        data = image.generate(code)
        return Response(data, mimetype="image/png")
